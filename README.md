# Discount Claims iOS App

## The app does the following:
* It provides shoppers with coupons for discounts through electronic kiosks that contain every
retailer’s offer.
* Shoppers can claim the offer through taking a picture of the offer.
* Each claim will allow the system to capture the consumer’s behavior and the location of the
poster.
* The user will be prompted to post the picture with the offer detail in social media.
* Once the post has been published on social media the user will be able to claim the offer.
* If a social media follower clicked on the link they would be directed to the offer.
